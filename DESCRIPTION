Title: MS reference library creation supporting multi-modular compound annotation

Description: A framework for creating MS libraries based on high resolution
    LC-MS data. The process depends upon preprocessed output from the xcms/CAMERA packages.
    It also relies on data from a predefined mix of chemical standards that were injected 
    with the biological samples. The runMatchWeiz function applies a multi-modular annotation 
    algorithm in order to match experimental data with the generated MS library.
